# Multiplayer Lobby Test Instructions

## Problem

Players joining the lobby don't see themselves in the list until they ready up, and the host doesn't see them either. Additionally, when settings update because of polling, the player list resets and players disappear.

## Root Cause Found

The issue was in the **lobbyService** methods (`updateGameSettings`, `updatePlayerReady`, `startGame`) which were using stale `this.currentLobby` references instead of getting fresh data from localStorage before making updates. This caused player data to be lost when lobby operations occurred.

## Fix Applied

1. **Fixed stale lobby references in lobbyService**:

   - `updateGameSettings()` now gets fresh lobby data before updating settings
   - `updatePlayerReady()` now gets fresh lobby data before updating ready status
   - `startGame()` now gets fresh lobby data before starting the game
   - Added debug logging to track player counts during updates

2. **Fixed game start propagation**: Added lobby status monitoring to both host and non-host polling functions to detect when the game starts and automatically navigate all players to the game view

3. **Improved host polling**: The host now always updates the player list during polling instead of only when changes are detected

4. **Immediate polling**: Both host and non-host players now do an immediate poll when the lobby view mounts

5. **Faster initial polling**: Reduced polling interval to 1 second for more responsive updates

6. **Timing fix**: Added small delay in onMounted to ensure localStorage operations complete

7. **Selective updates**: Both host and non-host polling now update only specific parts of the lobby data (players or settings) instead of replacing the entire object, preventing player list resets

## Test Steps

### Test 1: Host sees joining players

1. Open browser tab 1
2. Go to http://localhost:5173
3. Click "Multiplayer"
4. Click "Create New Lobby"
5. Enter name "Host" and create lobby
6. Note the lobby code

### Test 2: Player joins and is visible

1. Open browser tab 2 (or incognito)
2. Go to http://localhost:5173
3. Click "Multiplayer"
4. Click "Join Lobby"
5. Enter the lobby code from step 1
6. Enter name "Player1" and join
7. **Check**: Player1 should appear in the lobby immediately
8. **Check**: Host should see Player1 in the player list

### Test 3: Player sees themselves

1. In tab 2 (Player1), verify you see yourself in the player list
2. Verify you see the host in the player list
3. Click "Ready Up"
4. **Check**: Both tabs should show Player1 as ready

### Test 4: Multiple players

1. Open browser tab 3
2. Repeat join process with name "Player2"
3. **Check**: All three tabs should show all three players

### Test 5: Game Start Functionality

1. In the host tab (tab 1), ensure the "Start Game" button is disabled initially
2. Have Player1 (tab 2) click "Ready Up"
3. Have Player2 (tab 3) click "Ready Up"
4. **Check**: Host should see both players as ready
5. **Check**: The "Start Game" button should now be enabled for the host
6. Host clicks "Start Game"
7. **Check**: Host should navigate to the game view (`/lobby/[code]/game`)
8. **Check**: Player1 and Player2 should automatically navigate to the game view as well
9. **Check**: All players should see the multiplayer game interface

## Expected Results

- ✅ Players appear immediately when joining
- ✅ Host sees all players without needing to wait
- ✅ Players see themselves in the list
- ✅ Ready status updates work correctly
- ✅ Player count updates correctly
- ✅ Game starts for all players when host clicks "Start Game"
- ✅ All players navigate to the game view automatically

## Previous Issues Fixed

- Race condition between localStorage save/load operations
- Host polling only updating on detected changes
- Initial lobby load not getting latest data
- Polling not starting immediately
- Game start not propagating to other players (FIXED: Added lobby status monitoring in polling functions)
